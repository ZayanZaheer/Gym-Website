            <h1>Back Day WorkOuts</h1>
            <p>A back day workout tries to concentrate on movements that bolster and develop back muscle. You definitely break up your exercises into body component splits if you decide to undertake a back day.</p>
            <p>Simply said, this is a method of scheduling your exercises. It simply implies that you must concentrate just on one or two particular body areas during each exercise, like your back, as part of a bodybuilding plan with a lot of volume (sets and repetitions).</p>
            <p id="last">It is advisable to carry out the quantity of sets and repetitions required to promote strength and/or muscular development.</p>

                    <p>Your lats, which are sizable muscles on the sides of your back, are worked during a lat pulldown. Place your legs firmly behind the cushioned brace while you sit down at a lat pulldown machine. Choose the weight that you want to utilise. Grasp the bar with an overhand grip that feels natural to you. Resistance bands that are fastened to a fixed place may also be used for this activity.</p>
                    <p>With your back slightly arched and your chest up, brace your core. Lean back a little bit.</p>

                    <p>Deadlifts are a great lower back workout that work a variety of muscles, including your whole core, glutes, and hip flexors.</p>

                    <p>After pushing your bottom behind you, hinge your hips and bend your knees. Maintain a straight back. With your arms fully extended, reach for the dumbbells and take an overhand hold of them.</p>
                    <p>Dumbbells should be held near to your shins as you stand up holding them with palms facing your body. Do not round your back as you extend your hips forward.</p>
