            <h1>Bicep Day WorkOuts</h1>
            <p>Big biceps are a clear indication to the rest of the world that you have worked out hard. Although the biceps are modest muscles, developing them requires patience, wisdom, and clever programming.</p>
            <p>Not only do large biceps look fantastic, but they also have practical uses. Your biceps are working the next time you lift your child or do a flawless pull-up.</p>
            <p>The good news for you is that developing your biceps just requires you to curl repeatedly. And certain workouts work better than others at getting the job done.</p>
            <p id="last">We've put up a list of the top 5 biceps exercises so you can decide which is best for you.</p>

                        <li>3 - 4 sets of 10-12 reps</li>
                        <li>Make sure your elbows don't slip back to the side of your body, your shoulders don't slump forward, and your torso doesn't tilt forward.</li>

                    <p>A traditional biceps-builder is the barbell curl. When performed properly, this exercise, which concentrates on the biceps, may significantly enhance the strength and growth of the whole muscle.</p>
                    <p>As you raise a single object with both hands, the barbell curl allows you to curl more weight than other curl types.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, it is simple to complete. To raise a loaded barbell towards your chin, just grasp it with both hands. Repeat after me.</p>

                        <li>3 sets of 8-10 reps</li>
                        <li>You should softly kiss your shirt with the bar but avoid dragging it over your body with enough force to cause any friction.</li>

                <div class="exerciseexplaination">
                    <p>Almost all biceps' exercises need you to pin your upper arm to your chest and maintain that position throughout each session. Given that your biceps primarily influence your elbow joint, this is unquestionably sensible.</p>
                    <p>The drag curl's major advantages, however, come from taking advantage of where your biceps attach to your shoulder blade.</p>
                    <p>You may extend your biceps at one end and compress them at the other by pushing your elbow back behind you while you curl, producing unmatched tension.</p>

                        <li>4 sets of 10-15 reps</li>
                        <li>You may do the dumbbell curl by alternating one arm at a time or by curling both weights at once.</li>

                <div class="exerciseexplaination">
                    <p>Nothing is more gratifying than relentlessly working through set after set of dumbbell curls. The barbell may be difficult to use while working out your biceps (or may not be accessible at all in a busy gym).</p>
                    <p>With dumbbells, you have greater mobility and can flex each arm independently without having to rely on your stronger biceps to support the weight of the weaker side.</p>
                    <p>The dumbbell curl is a genuine grab-and-go exercise since dumbbells are available in almost every gym.</p>

                        <li>To get the most out of this exercise, concentrate on contracting your biceps at the peak of each rep.</li>

                <div class="exerciseexplaination">
                    <p>You must curl dumbbells with your hands facing each other for the hammer curl. Most people find this neutral wrist posture to be more comfortable, and it should enable you to curl bigger weights, encouraging more muscular development.</p>
                    <p>The hammer curl increases arm thickness by working the biceps brachialis and brachioradialis.</p>
                    <p>This will be helpful whether your goal is to develop a strong grip to sustain heavy deadlifts or to bulk up your body.</p>

                        <li>The secret is to maintain tension on the biceps throughout the whole range of motion.</li>

                <div class="exerciseexplaination">
                    <p>Feeling your biceps contract is the key to the concentration curl. You curl a dumbbell from its full extension to contraction while seated on a bench with your elbow resting on the inner of your thigh.</p>
                    <p>You put in more effort overall when you lift with one arm at a time. Additionally, you'll give your less powerful arm a chance to catch up to your stronger one.</p>
                    <p>As you curl a light dumbbell, the isolated curling stance truly enables you to focus on your biceps.</p>
