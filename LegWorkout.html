            <h1>Leg Day WorkOuts</h1>
            <p>Without a question, one of the hardest body components to exercise is the leg. This is because the legs are a vast muscular group that demands a lot of effort and focus.</p><br>
            <p>Legs often have their own dedicated day in programmes like PPL, which means that on that day, you will exclusively workout your legs.</p><br>
            <p>You have your push day on the first day. You'll perform your pull day the following day. Finally, you'll get to the legs.</p><br>
            <p id="last">You may then completely concentrate on developing your legs without any interruptions.</p><br>

                        <p>1. Squats</p>
                        <li>4 sets of 8-10 reps</li>
                        <li>Use a barbell, dumbbells, or a Smith machine for added resistance if available.</li>

                    <p>The king of all leg exercises is the squat. They are the ideal exercise for developing huge legs since they work every leg muscle.</p>
                    <p>Your quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes will all be worked out with this complex action. Squats may also be used to develop a strong core, which is particularly advantageous.</p>
                    <p>However, it's crucial that you carry out this leg workout—or any exercise, for that matter—properly.</p>
                    <p>If you don't use the right form, you risk hurting your back, knees, and hips, which might keep you from working for a few weeks or, in the worst case, months.</p>

                    <p>The leg press is the next exercise. Another powerful exercise for developing the legs of a tree trunk is the leg press. It doesn't need a lot of coordination and is quite simple to do.</p>
                    <p>The leg press is regarded as a complex exercise that works all the muscles in your legs, much as squats do.</p>
                    <p>This exercise will work your quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes without placing too much stress on your spine if you do it correctly. Because of this, some individuals like it over doing squats.</p>

                <div class="exerciseexplaination">
                    <p>Hack squats are a great leg workout as well. The complete leg muscles are worked during this exercise, just as during a typical squat, but the quadriceps are particularly highlighted.</p>
                    <p>With hack squats, you won't have to worry about stability, allowing you to devote all of your energy and attention on developing your legs.</p>
                    <p>Increasing your range of motion (ROM) by doing hack squats might also assist you improve your squat form.</p>

                    <p>The quadriceps, hamstrings, and glutes are worked with the simple, yet very efficient exercise known as the lunge.</p>

                    <p>Leg curls are the next exercise on the list; they are another machine-based isolation exercise that works the hamstring muscles.</p>
                    <p>Leg curls are a great exercise for developing hamstrings that are both powerful and flexible. In our view, it's a move that must be made if you want to train your legs as effectively as possible.</p>

                    <p>The standing calf raise is the last exercise we'll cover. As you can see, it's an exercise that primarily targets the calf muscles.</p>
                    <p>Some of you will have access to a calf raise machine, but if you're inventive, you can also do the exercise with free weights.</p>
                    <p>Don't forget to incorporate at least one exercise that works the calves in your leg workouts. To strike the muscle from the best angle, it is preferable to do a motion like the calf raise.</p>
